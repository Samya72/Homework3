Is there any association between birth month and being a morning, a night person, or neither.

# Data Set

It is based on a survey of Advanced Data Analysis students at Brown School, Washington University in Saint Louis. The survey was carried through an online link, The data set has 29 observations and 27 variables covering survey questions. 

# The code: 

After data management through renaming variables, checking for unusual or missing values and addressing that, and since birth month variable is a numerical and being a lurk, an owl, or a hummingbird is a categorical one, I opted for a density plots which allows me to get the probability density. I used ggplot with geom density, then I labeled the x and y axes and the graph title, then I filled the density plots with different colors according to the different categories.
