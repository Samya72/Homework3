## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##
##
#### 1. Import class one survey data from our Github site (https://github.com/kijohnson/ADA-2024) (The dataset is called ‘Class 1 Survey Fall 2024_di.csv’), calling the R dataframe that you create C1survey.

```{r Import Data}

library(dplyr)
library(readr)
#Import survey data
C1survey <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kijohnson/ADA-2024/main/Class%201%20(Getting%20started%20and%20RR%20I)/Lab/Class%201%20Survey%20Fall%202024_di.csv")

```
##
##
##### 2. Determine: **a.** the number of observations (i.e. the number of people who filled out the survey) and **b.** the number of variables in the dataframe.

```{r Number_Observation_Variables}

# a and b determine number of observations and variables in C1survey dataset
dim(C1survey)
# there are 29 observations and 27 variables
str(C1survey)


```

##
##
##### 3. **a.** Rename the column variables to something shorter and that is descriptive of what the variable is about (for example *like_dogs* for the 'Do you like dogs?' question variable) and **b.** Display that they are renamed.

```{r Rename_Column_ Variables}
# use names function to rename the 27 variables in order
names(C1survey)[1:27]<-c("id", "like_cats", "like_dogs", "have_desert", "slogan", "fav_day", "larkORowl", "fav_food", "fav_drink", "fav_season", "fav_month", "hobby", "program", "specialization", "stat_software", "R_exp", "coding_comfort", "coding_length", "top_three","public_health_interest", "fav_num", "bday", "bmonth", "country", "state", "city", "highest_educ_level")

# b. display the renamed variables
colnames(C1survey)

```

##
##
##### 4. Write code to determine and display the number of factor, integer, numerical, and character variables there are in the *C1survey* dataset.

```{r}
sapply(C1survey, class) # solution 1 using sapply function

str(C1survey) # solution 2 using str function
table(sapply(C1survey, class)) # solution 3 is the best solution using table and sapply functions 23 character and 4 integer
summary(C1survey)

```

##
##
##### 5. **a.** Using code, check the *bday* and *bmonth* variables for any unusual or missing values. If you find any, **b.** describe what you will do with the unusual values in a comment before or immediately following the code that does it, and **c.** after you have cleaned up any unusual values, find the median bday and month. *Note: please make sure that your bday and month variables are numeric before doing statistics.

```{r Unusual_Missing_Values Recoding Convert}
# a. look at values for bday and bmonth
C1survey$bday
C1survey$bmonth

# b. recode  bday with non numeric values

# bday recoding method 1
class(C1survey$bday) # check that it is coded as character class
C1survey$bday<-ifelse(C1survey$bday == "May 21-report 21", "21", C1survey$bday)
C1survey$bday<-ifelse(C1survey$bday == "March 31st", "31", C1survey$bday)
C1survey$bday # check values 

# convert to numeric for statistics
C1survey$bday<-as.numeric(C1survey$bday)
table(C1survey$bday, useNA = "always") # check values 

# bmonth recoding
class(C1survey$bmonth)

C1survey$bmonth[C1survey$bmonth=="May 21-report 5"]<-"5"
C1survey$bmonth[C1survey$bmonth=="February"]<-"2"
C1survey$bmonth[C1survey$bmonth=="September"]<-"9"
C1survey$bmonth[C1survey$bmonth=="July"]<-"7"
C1survey$bmonth[C1survey$bmonth=="March"]<-"3"
C1survey$bmonth # check values 

# convert to numeric for statistics
C1survey$bmonth<-as.numeric(C1survey$bmonth)
C1survey$bmonth # check values 

# c. calculate medians for bday and bmonth 
median(C1survey$bday, na.rm=TRUE) # 14 (biased because of 0, which is not a value)
median(C1survey$bmonth, na.rm=TRUE) # 7

```

##
##
##### 6. **a.** Create a new variable called *bseason* that gives the season according to Northern Meteorological season in which respondents were born (winter = 12/1 to 2/29, spring = 3/1 to 5/31, summer = 6/1 to 8/31, fall = 9/1 to 11/30). **b**. Using the table function, print a table of Seasons in the columns and bmonths in the rows that allows you to check that the coding is correct **c**. Sum the columns using the addmargins function to answer the question of how many classmates were born in each season? Include your answer in the code.

```{r bSeason_Variable}
# a.
# using dplyr
C1survey <- C1survey %>%
  mutate(bseason=case_when(bmonth %in% c(12,1,2) ~"Winter",
                           bmonth %in% c(3,4,5) ~"Spring",
                           bmonth %in% c(6,7,8) ~"Summer",
                           bmonth %in% c(9,10,11) ~"Fall"))
table(C1survey$bmonth, C1survey$bseason) # check variable

C1survey$bseason_f<-factor(C1survey$bseason, levels=c("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall"))


# b. 
table(C1survey$bmonth, C1survey$bseason)
table(C1survey$bmonth, C1survey$bseason_f)

# c.
tab<-addmargins(table(C1survey$bmonth, C1survey$bseason, useNA = "always"), 1)
tab
tab<-addmargins(table(C1survey$bmonth, C1survey$bseason_f, useNA = "always"), 1)
tab

# Births by season: Fall = 4 Winter = 9 Spring = 8 Summer = 8


```

##### 7. Pick your favorite variable or variables to analyze, come up with a question you want to answer with that variable or variables, generate the code, and provide an answer to your question. Describe what you did using comments (i.e. #'s).

##### 7. Is there any association between birth month and being a lurk, an owl, or a hummingbird?

```{r favorite_variables}

# Density plots of birth month by Whether being a lurk, an owl, or a hummingbird.

C1survey %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = C1survey$bmonth)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = larkORowl), alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Birth month", y = "probability density", 
       title = "Distribution of Birth Month by Whether Being a Lurk, an Owl, or a Hummingbird") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue","pink","turquoise"), 
                    name = "Being a lurk, an owl, or a hummingbird")

# Students born around the month of February are more likely to be a morning person.
# Students born around the month of June to December are more likely to be a night person.
# Students born around the month of May are more likely to be neither.

```
